# Grass Roots Cyber - Statement of Organization

## Name
Grass Roots Cyber ("the Organization")

## Type
Unincorporated Nonprofit Association operating in the State of Illinois.

## Purpose
Grass Roots Cyber exists to promote cybersecurity awareness, education, and resilience at the community level, with a focus on Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS), digital stewardship, and regenerative technological practices.

## Membership
Membership is open to individuals and organizations that support the mission and principles of the Organization. Members may join by signing the Membership Agreement publicly or via verified consent using any approved distributed signing method.

Members are expected to:
- Uphold the values of cyber resilience, transparency, mutual aid, and ethical technology.
- Participate in community decision-making processes.

## Governance
Grass Roots Cyber operates using a **decentralized, asymmetric model** inspired by **Open Space Technology (OST)** principles. This means:
- Leadership and facilitation emerge from participation, not title.
- Decisions are made by those present and engaged.
- Meetings are guided by self-organization and mutual respect.

No hierarchical leadership structure is imposed; instead, the community governs itself through circles of responsibility and spontaneous contribution.

This Statement of Organization is a **living document**. It evolves as the needs and insights of the community evolve. All changes will be version-controlled and logged publicly.

## Dissolution
The Organization **may not be dissolved** through an OST-style session or otherwise unless **100% of all current verified members agree to dissolution**. This clause is non-negotiable and reflects the community’s commitment to resilience.
