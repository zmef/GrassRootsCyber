# Grass Roots Cyber - Community Charter

## Preamble
Grass Roots Cyber exists to cultivate a digitally resilient future rooted in openness, mutual aid, and community empowerment. This Charter expresses our shared values, cultural norms, and guiding principles—not as law, but as a living agreement.

We are not here to enforce control, but to build trust.
We are not bound by hierarchy, but united by purpose.
We are not waiting for permission—we are creating the future now.

## Core Values

### 🌱 Regeneration
We believe in sustainable, life-affirming systems—online and off. We steward technology as a shared commons and treat digital infrastructure as part of our ecosystem.

### 🐧 FLOSS & Freedom
We support Free/Libre/Open Source Software. Code is speech. Transparency builds trust. Everyone deserves access to the tools of empowerment.

### 🛠️ Mutual Aid & Resilience
Security is a shared responsibility. We help each other learn, grow, and protect what matters. We are gremlins of resilience, not gatekeepers of compliance.

### 🧠 Curiosity & Creativity
We explore, tinker, reverse-engineer, and remix. Playfulness is a path to insight. Humor is part of our threat model.

### 🫂 Inclusion & Autonomy
All are welcome who come in good faith. We honor diversity, self-determination, and the right to participate in ways that fit each person's life.

## Participation Principles
- **Whoever shows up is the right person.**
- **Whenever it starts is the right time.**
- **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.**
- **When it’s over, it’s over.**
- **If you’re not learning or contributing, use your two feet.**

These Open Space Technology (OST) principles are how we gather, decide, and build.

## Decision-Making
We do not vote—we convene.
Ideas are proposed, discussed, and acted upon by those present.
Authority is earned through participation, not assigned by role.
Decisions are made transparently and iteratively.

## Trust & Safety
- Conflicts are addressed with honesty, care, and restoration—not punishment.
- Harassment, exploitation, or sabotage will not be tolerated.
- When harm occurs, we prioritize listening, accountability, and repair.

## Identity & Recognition
- Members may identify by name, pseudonym, collective, or organization.
- Contributions are credited, not hoarded.
- No one speaks for Grass Roots Cyber—but everyone contributes to its voice.

## Evolution
This Charter is a living document. Anyone may propose changes. Updates require open discussion and visible consensus among active members.
